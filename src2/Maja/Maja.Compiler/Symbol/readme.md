# Symbol

A symbol is a named code element that can be referred to by that name.

Symbols are declared by declaration statements (function, type or variable declarations)
and can be referenced by name.

They serve a different purpose as the IR-related types.
Symbols are all about resolving references to declarations and matching types etc.
Symbols have no reference to the syntax (location), that is in the IR-model.
