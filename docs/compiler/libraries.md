# Libraries

A library (meta) format for including reusable code in program.
Source code only inclusion. Everything is compiled (and optimized) at the same time.

## Dependencies

Need to publish required dependencies of the library itself. Libraries can depend on libraries.

## Versioning

Libraries have a specific version. Use semantic versioning (semver) and a naming mechanism to find correct files.
