# Compile Time Text Generation

Allow 'macros'? to generate text at compile time.

This text can be code or data or any other text.

You could even generate binary data.

- The target would be a string or a file.
- Multiple strings or files can be generated.
- Comparison if generated (file) content has changed.
- Extend generated code with custom file content (partial).

Use a special (compile-time) syntax to output strings? (think razor engine and T4 and the like)
