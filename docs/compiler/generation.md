# Compile Time Text Generation

Allow 'macros'? to generate text at compile time.

This text can be code or data or any other text.

You could even generate binary data.

- The target would be a file.
- Multiple files can be generated.
- Comparison if generated content has changed.
- Extend generated code with custom file content.
