# Set

> Research set theory.

are sets ordered (index) or unordered?

functions

- union
- intersects
- difference
- is sub / super set
- add / remove (join/disjoin?)
- contains
- iterator

## Set Operators

Set Theory? Set, intersect, union, subset, superset, powerset, (relative) complement, symmetric difference, membership, cardinality, ordered pair, cartesian product, wellknown sets (natural, integer, rational, real, complex).

Operations

| Operator | Fn Name | Description
|--|--|--
| `|` | Union | union sets (duplicates overwritten)
| `&` | Intersection | intersection sets (only shared elements)
| `&~` | Difference | difference sets (left without right)
| `~&` | Difference | difference sets (right without left)
| `~` | Difference | symmetric difference (only unique elements)

Comparison

| Operator | Fn Name | Description
|--|--|--
| `=` | Equal | Exact equality
| `<>` | NotEqual | Exact inequality
| `=<` | SubSetOrEqual | left is a subset of right or equal
| `>=` | SuperSetOrEqual | left is a superset of right or equal
| `<` | SubSet | left is subset of right
| `>` | SuperSet | left is a superset of right
| `in` | Contains | an element is contained in set
| `not in` | NotContains | an element is not contained in set

Arithemtic

Is this even a thing?

| Operator | Fn Name | Description
|--|--|--
| `+` | AddSet | Add each element of the sets together to form a new set
| `-` | AddSet | Subtract each element of the sets from each other to form a new set

etc...
