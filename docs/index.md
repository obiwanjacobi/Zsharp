# Z\#

Z# (Zee-Sharp) is a simple language with modern features initially envisioned for restricted instruction sets,
like the old 8-bit CPUs (Z80) or small micro controllers. But now I am trying to get it to target .NET.

It is also an opportunity to do better what I think lacks in other languages. 
A goal that seemed simple when I started this project. Lets just say it has been a learning experience.

More on the Design goals of Z# [here](design.md)

Take a look at some samples [here](samples.md)

## Work In Progress

I am still playing with the syntax, concepts and constructs of the language. Things will change!
Several pages have half finished notes on them. I write these down in a super short format to serve a reminder for me.
I am slowly transferring the notes I had written down in a private document, into this documentation - given me a chance to reconsider and make sure things stay as consistent as possible.

## Facebook

I have created a [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/724275751426108/) for discussing ZLang and Z#.

## TODO

- FSM syntax? (will match do?)
- RingBuffer type?
- Set type (set-theory)?
