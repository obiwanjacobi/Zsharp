# Finite State Machine

Ideas for a baked-in DSL for generating code using a FSM language.

FSM language examples:

- Lucy: https://lucylang.org/docs/language/

Directed Graph language examples:

- DOT: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html

---

## Machine

The container for a state machine definition.

- context: a structure with all data fields used by the state machine.

---

## State

- name
- entry / exit state events
- custom events that cause state transition
- immediate / auto transition (executed when entering the state)
- available actions on state (side effects) / calling external functions
- initial, final and nested state (nested machines?)

---

## Event

A representation of an external occurrence.

Causes a transition from the current state (on which the event is declared) to a new state.

---

## Code Generation

No functions are generated - they are all implemented externally to the state machine.

### Context

The machine context is auto generated by analyzing what fields are referenced in the dsl. The structure can be extended with custom fields. The structure is passed in as a template or generic parameter.
