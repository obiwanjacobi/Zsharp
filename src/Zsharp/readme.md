# Zsharp

## TODO

- Check unit test coverage
- change grammar for Variable_def_typed_init so it can reuse Variable_def_typed (as child)?
- Variable/Assignment. Always use assignment for all variable decls/refs? Variable no longer a CodeBlockItem.
- rethink ResolveSymbols/ResolveTypes. Do these need to be separate or integrated?
- Create AstErrors during Semantic processing.
- A pipeline to sequence the steps necessary for a full compile?
